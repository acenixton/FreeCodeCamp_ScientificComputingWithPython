# FreeCodeCamp_ScientificComputingWithPython
My solutions to the 5 [certification]([url](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/acenixton/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)) projects for this [FreeCodeCamp course]([url](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)).

I worked on this in parallel to my course work, which at the time mostly consisted of much less complex projects.
