# FreeCodeCamp_ScientificComputingWithPython
My solutions to the 5 [certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/acenixton/scientific-computing-with-python-v7) projects for this [FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

I worked on this in parallel to my course work, which at the time mostly consisted of much less complex projects.
